                <p2>A wormhole is actually a very tiny tear in the fabric of space-time, about 
                    10-33 cm. It is an idea that has blurry lines and was most explored by Albert 
                    Einstein and Nathan Rosen. They called wormholes the Einstein-Rosen Bridge. 
                    They connect two places in any space or time....</p2>

            <p1>Neutron Stars<br></p1>
            <p2>Neutron stars have some of the strongest gravitational and
                magnetic fields in the universe. The gravity is strong enough to 
                flatten almost anything on the surface. The magnetic fields of 
                neutron stars can be a billion times to a million billion times the 
                magnetic field on the surface of Earth....</p2>

            <p1>Black Holes<br></p1>
                <p2>Black holes are some of the strangest and most fascinating objects in outer space. 
                    They're extremely dense, with such strong gravitational attraction that even light 
                    cannot escape their grasp if it comes near enough</p2>
